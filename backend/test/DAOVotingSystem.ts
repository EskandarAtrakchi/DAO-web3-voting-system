/**Key test cases:
Deployment: Validates that the owner is added as a member and that the treasury starts at zero.
Membership: Ensures that only the owner can add new members.
Proposals: Allows a member to create a proposal, emits an event on creation, and checks that the proposal's properties are set correctly.
Voting: Ensures members can vote, prevents double voting, and checks the voting result.
DAO Stats: Retrieves stats like total proposals, active proposals, and members, with average participation calculated.
Treasury: Tests the treasury functionality including receiving funds, withdrawing, and updating the treasury history. */
